List of things to do:

 CollisionSolver
-----------------
* Bug in CollisionSolver causes that in some times collisions generated by rotations are not 
  properly recognized. I think that it is caused because rotation sense is not alwais correctly 
  detected.
* When a body collides hardly ever collision sense is not properly detected. This is because to 
  check collision sense it checks if relative collision position vector and collision sense forms 
  angle between -90ยบ and +90ยบ. This is not alwais true
    Example:
            collSense^
          /   ร relPos^
         /    | /         /
        /     |/         /
       +------/\--------+
             /  \
* Add friction.

 ScenePhysics
--------------
* Fix SimulationThread pause wich generates program crash.
+ Execute physics in 2 threads one for Bodys on scene and other less prioritazed for out of scene 
  bodys.

 SceneCollider
---------------
+ Optimize Collision Checks

 Misc
------
+ Complete Body preferences menus.
+ Complete program settings.
+ Add textures support
